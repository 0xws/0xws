TypeScript brings safety and scalability to JavaScript. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here are some hard-won lessons.

---

## 🧼 1. Prefer `type` over `interface`

```ts
// ✅ Better
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

// ❌ Avoid when not extending
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

Use `type` for union, intersection, and readability.

---

## 📁 2. Modularize Types

Avoid a `types.ts` god file. Instead:

* Co-locate types with domain logic
* Export them from index if needed

```ts
// user/types.ts
export type User = { id: number; name: string };

// user/index.ts
export * from "./types";
```

---

## 🧪 3. Use Narrow Types

Instead of generic types:

```ts
// ❌
function log(level: string) {}

// ✅
type LogLevel = "info" | "warn" | "error";
function log(level: LogLevel) {}
```

---

## 📌 4. Enforce `strict` mode

Enable in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true
  }
}
```

This avoids silent type issues.

---

## 📚 5. Document Complex Types

```ts
/**
 * Represents a GitHub API user payload
 */
type GitHubUser = {
  login: string;
  id: number;
  avatar_url: string;
};
```

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

> TypeScript doesn't just catch bugs — it also documents intent.

## 🔗 Recommended Tools

* ESLint with `@typescript-eslint`
* TypeDoc
* ts-prune (find unused types)
