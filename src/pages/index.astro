  <h1>Welcome !</h1>

  <p>
    ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m ws (/vaÉªs/), a DevSecOps engineer. This site is the place
    to gather my projects and thoughts on everything I like. From IT
    to anything related to cars and / or electronics.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm mostly working with Typescript, Python, Rust and Zig as daily
    drivers. These help me to perform my tasks in full-stack web development,
    system development, gamedev and plenty of other tasks.

    On the infrastructure side, I'm mostly using Terraform/OpenTofu, K8s
    and NixOS.
  </p>
